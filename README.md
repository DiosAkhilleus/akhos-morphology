# akhos-morphology

Intending on making a better (or at least prettier) version of the Perseus morphological tool.

This tool uses both the Latin and Greek morphology tools from the Perseids project (https://www.perseids.org/)

For the short definitions, I used the WikiMedia REST Api to fetch a definition for the corresponding headword. This won't always come back defined due to the limitations of the WikiMedia API.

For the long definitions, I used the Perseus Project XML API.

Please enjoy, and I hope it's in some way helpful in your quest to learn and read the Classical Languages.
