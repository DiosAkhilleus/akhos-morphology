# akhos-morphology

Intending on making a better (or at least prettier) version of the Perseus morphological tool.

This tool uses both the Latin and Greek morphology tools from the Perseids project (https://www.perseids.org/)

I was able to find neither a Greek nor Latin lexicon API, so I make use of the WikiMedia REST API in order to fetch the headword definitions.

Please enjoy, and I hope it's in some way helpful in your quest to learn and read the Classical Languages.
